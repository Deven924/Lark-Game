You walk through the hallway.

It's a dead end.

However, there is a chest at the end!

You can use the ls -F command to distinguish between rooms (directories) and objects (files)

Executables will have an asterisk (*) beside their filename.

Type in ./script-name in order to execute a script!

In this case, open the chest using the following command:

./chest

When you are done looting the chest, you should return to the previous room.

You can do this using the following command:

cd ..

This command takes you to the previous room (directory).

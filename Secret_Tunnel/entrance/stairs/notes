As you walk up the stairs, you see 4 doors, each with a stone creature head built in.

The doors are as follows:
dragon
wolf
snake
eagle

You can choose any of these rooms, however you will only have access to that room once you choose it..

If you have visited the hallway, we will be executing scripts a little differently here.

From now on, you will be using the source command to execute any scripts.

Source is a command that keeps any changes done in the script and applies them to your character, 
such as if a script adds health or an item to the inventory.

In whatever room you enter, use the following command format:

source script-name

Good luck!

As you walk up the stairs, you see 4 doors, each with a stone creature head built in.

The doors are as follows:
dragon
wolf
snake
eagle

You can choose any of these rooms.

Unlike in the previous treasure chest, we will not be using ./ to execute scripts here.

From now on, you will be using the source command to execute any scripts.

Source is a command that keeps any changes done in the script and applies them to your character, such as if a script adds health or an item to the inventory.

In whatever room you enter, use the following command format:

source script-name

Good luck!

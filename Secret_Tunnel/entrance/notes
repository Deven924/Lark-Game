You enter a barren room.

As far as you can see, there is only a staircase going up.
However, you notice out of the corner of your eye a hallway to the left..

In order to distinguish between items(files/scripts) and rooms(directories), use the following command:

ls -F

Otherwise, continue up the staircase using cd stairs/.

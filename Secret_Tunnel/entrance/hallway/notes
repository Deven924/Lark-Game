You walk through the hallway.

It's a dead end.

However, there is a chest at the end!

When you open it, you are met with thick webs, likely due to the chest sitting untouched for ages.

In order to search for any loot, we can use the grep command!

The grep command specifies a pattern to search for.

In this case, lets grep for loot!

The command is:

ls -F oldChest/ | grep loot




When you are done looting the chest, you should return to the previous room.

You can do this using the following command:

cd ..

This command takes you to the previous room (directory).

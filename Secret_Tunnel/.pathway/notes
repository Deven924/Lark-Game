As you walk through the short pathway, you notice that there is a massive door at the end.

However, rubble is in the way!

Let's create a script to remove this rubble so that we can go to the next room!

There is part of a script that needs you to fill it in.

To access the script, type in vim removeRubble!

Vim is an editor that allows you to edit both text and scripts!

Try it out!

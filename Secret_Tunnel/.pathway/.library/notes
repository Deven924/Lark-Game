You have entered the book room and notice the tall shelfs of books that seem to go on forever. 

In the back of the room, there is a bright white light.

In the center of the room, there is a floating book, which you assume to have magical properties. 

You make your way to the book to see what's inside it.

From now on, we will be executing scripts a little differently.

In cases like using the scroll, we want to ensure that the effects are assigned to you.

When we use ./script to execute a script, we potentially lose any values that could be assigned to us.

To execute scripts, use the following command:

source script-name
